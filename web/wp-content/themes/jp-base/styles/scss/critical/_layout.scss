// Layout styles
// These are the few reusable classes to use that accomplish the layout of the page, mostly to keep a common max-width and margins.


// NOTE - The main layout mixin you'll need is l-container().
// Check in `inc/mixins-layout.scss` for more info.


// .l-module is meant to be used on any outer container for a page builder module (AKA flex content layouts). Use this to control the margin between page builder sections.
// You might need to add some additional classes like "has-background" or "has-color" to further control margin/padding.
.l-module {

	+ .l-module {
		// margin-top: 7rem;
	}

}
